# S4's replay engine — the patch queue's whole lifecycle, everything the Replay workflow
# (.github/workflows/replay.yml) rides:
#
#   parity    main mirrors upstream byte-for-byte outside the fork-infra allowlist (D6)
#   sync      merge upstream/main into main — the mirror tracks upstream's release cadence
#   replay    the queue: three-outcome rule per patch, into a worktree, force-push aps/main
#   validate  upstream's own validators (codespell, docker-lint, json-validator) against a tree
#
# WHY PARITY IS TWO DIFFS, NOT ONE EXCLUDE LIST. The naive form — diff upstream..main excluding
# the allowlist — goes silent-green the day upstream ships a file at an allowlisted path: its
# side of the diff gets excluded too. The collision-safe form asserts both directions instead:
#   (a) --diff-filter=MD is EMPTY: no upstream file is modified or missing on main — with NO
#       excludes, so an upstream file landing on an allowlisted path reads as a modification
#       and fails LOUDLY (a human renames our file or restructures; never a silent exclusion);
#   (b) --diff-filter=A ⊆ allowlist: everything main adds beyond upstream is fork-infra.
# The allowlist is exactly the D6 amendment recorded with images.yml: images.yml, replay.yml,
# .codespellrc (slice 11's forced extension — see allowlisted()'s comment), scripts/,
# patches/, BUGS.md (BUGS.md is slice 23's deliverable, pre-listed so it never breaks parity
# when it lands) — and readme.md is the ONE declared modification (slice 23): the fork declaration rides main's landing page under the strip-and-compare exception in cmd_parity — see DECLARED_MOD's comment; the (b) half is untouched, so upstream ever deleting readme.md turns main's copy into a rogue addition a human reconciles.
# Prefix entries are safe BECAUSE (a) still catches upstream adding anything
# under them as a missing file.
#
# WHY THE QUEUE REPLAYS FROM THE UPSTREAM TIP, NEVER FROM aps/main. aps/main is force-pushed CI
# output — replaying onto it would let one run's leftovers answer for the next. Every run
# rebuilds the whole tree from upstream's tip + the queue, so the three-outcome rule (ADR-0002,
# lifted to the fork) reads cleanly per patch: forward-dry-run applies; reverse-dry-run means
# upstream adopted the change (skip, and consider dropping the patch — the log says so);
# neither means upstream moved out from under it — abort, naming the patch (a red run IS the
# drift signal, never a reason to force anything; the bar is ≤6 weeks behind upstream). git
# apply is the tool on purpose: no fuzzy context, ever — a patch that only applies with fuzz
# is a patch that rots (the slice-4 ratification's strictness-is-a-feature rule). Patches are
# generated with git diff (a/ b/ prefixes) — that is the queue's file format.
#
# THE COVERAGE RULE, enforced before anything moves: every patch in the queue must be named by
# a row in scripts/brand-gate.sh or scripts/acquisition-gate.sh. A patch without a row changes
# the shipped tree with nothing measuring the change — unaudited (the gestion#170 lesson: a
# detector that stopped detecting looks like a quiet week). The same contract is what keeps CI
# green while the queue fills: rows FIRE only for queued patches, so the empty queue of slice
# 7 is an honest green, and every patch slice (8-13) lights its rows the moment it lands.
#
# Script patches (*.sh in the queue) are the generated channel: 010 will call
# scripts/retag.sh sed — ONE rule, never a hand-edited containers.json. They run with cwd =
# the worktree and APS_TOOLS_ROOT pointing at this checkout (the worktree carries NO
# fork-infra — it is upstream + patches, nothing else), and they are idempotent by contract:
# their own verify is the outcome (retag.sh sed dies if any upstream ref survives).
#
# Env (all overridable — the whole engine is offline-testable against scratch remotes, the
# slice-6 design-time de-risk pattern): REPLAY_UPSTREAM_REMOTE (upstream), REPLAY_UPSTREAM_URL
# (https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one.git), REPLAY_FORK_REMOTE (origin), REPLAY_APS_BRANCH
# (aps/main), REPLAY_TREE (.aps-replay-tree), REPLAY_PUSH (1; "0" = prove without publishing —
# the PR arm: parity, coverage, three-outcome, validators and gates all run, aps/main is never
# touched).

# The fork-infra allowlist (the D6 amendment): paths upstream does not ship. Exact entries

# because parity's (a) half still catches upstream ever adding anything under them).
# .codespellrc (slice 11's forced extension): patch 060's es-CL sweep puts correct Spanish

# main — upstream's own codespell workflow fires on both surfaces and flags the same 16
# correct words, so the ignore-list config must exist on main (this allowlist entry) and in

# the coverage-rule + codespell-green checks are the operational proof).
