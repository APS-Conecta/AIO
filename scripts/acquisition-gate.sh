# S4's acquisition gate — the installer never reaches a non-APS-Conecta source at install time
# (the steer's channel-completeness principle). Two check classes:
#
# UNCONDITIONAL — true of upstream's own tree; our patches must never break them, and an
# upstream change that does is the drift signal, loudly:
#   - zero `git clone` across the runtime surfaces (every *.sh under Containers/ and php/ —
#     the scripts the shipped containers execute). Measured: upstream ships none. The one git
#     clone upstream does ship is talk-recording's Dockerfile — BUILD-time, in a sibling we
#     retag and never build; the *.sh scoping excludes it by construction. gestion's
#     ensure_own_app clone channel is dev-only and superseded by the bake (research-verified)
#     — that half lives in gestion, not in this repo.
#   - the entrypoint still honors the skip.update marker (honored at :185, deleted at :1154
#     today): the migration channel (slice 22) sets it, and with the store off it is
#     load-bearing for migrated clinics.
#
# ROWS — the same contract as brand-gate.sh: a row fires only when its patch is queued.
#   020 — the store-off bake: NC_appstoreenabled="0" ENV in the nextcloud Dockerfile. With the
#         store on, occ upgrade re-downloads every enabled app and no VENDOR pin can hold
#         (gestion #163); the bake + this ENV make the entrypoint's store legs fail-fast.
#   040 — self-update opt-in (slice 9): the automatic_updates checkbox defaults OFF and the
#         wizard carries zero watchtower POST forms. The update channel stays deliberate —
#         D12's one-distribution rule makes even an opted-in nightly watchtower run a no-op
#         (a published tag's digests never move) until the operator runs a new tag on purpose.
#   051 — deSEC removal (slice 10, the v0.2.0 spec): zero deSEC surfaces across templates and
#         public assets; the own-domain form stays as the positive control. The PHP routes
#         (index.php's /desec + /api/desec/register, DesecManager) stay as unreachable dead
#         code per the zero-PHP rule — unreachable because the markup that reached them is
#         what this patch deletes.
#   030 — the bake (slice 13): three rows. (1) The bake channel is checksum-gated at build
#         time — scripts/bake.sh re-runs gestion's VENDOR sha256 gate before any tarball
#         enters the image; the tarball BYTES are gestion-side (test.sh:63-70), so this row
#         pins the MECHANISM to the fork. (2) The suite's skeleton posture is baked —
#         NC_skeletondirectory="" ENV beside 020's store-off (the compose stack's own key,
#         compose.yaml: the wizard's admin is created before any phase can write config, and
#         the NC_ channel is read before config.php). (3) The bake's runtime half is wired —
#         the aps-bake COPY lines and the ENV_PREFIX wiring grep present in the replayed
#         Dockerfile; without this row a regenerated 030 that loses them replays green on
#         every other row and ships an unbaked image (the one silently-unbaked-green path
#         nothing else closes). The plan's fourth row — curl in the runtime apk set — was
#         dropped live per FINDINGS P6: /usr/bin/curl 8.22.0 measured PRESENT in the AIO
#         runtime (transitive apk dep; phase 07's AIA fetch already imported the GlobalSign
#         intermediate on the probe), so the premise "the AIO runtime shipped no curl" was
#         falsified and the explicit apk entry would pin a dependency that already ships.
#
# ROUTED (this repo cannot see these channels — recorded so the ledger stays complete, the
# slice-4 curl→030 precedent): VENDOR sha256s are gestion-side (test.sh:63-70 already gates
# them); the host-bundle sha256 is the gestion Release page (slice 19); data-package
# checksums are slice 21. Every channel the AIO tree CAN see is checked here or in
# brand-gate.sh.
#
# Usage: scripts/acquisition-gate.sh TREE     (TREE = the replayed tree, e.g. .aps-replay-tree)
