# The bake's build-time half (FRD S3). Patch 030's runtime half is two COPY lines in the
# Dockerfile; this script is what produces the bytes they copy. It runs ON THE IMAGES RUNNER,
# never in the image.
#
# WHAT THIS IS. The suite's apps and the apsconecta theme arrive in the image instead of the
# app store: the store is baked off (020's ENV), a published tag's digests never move (D12), so
# nothing can fetch apps later — and a first boot must already carry every app the wizard
# starts containers for. notify_push first of all: the entrypoint installs it from the store
# on every start when it is absent (entrypoint.sh:726-733), and store-off makes that leg fail —
# the FRD's "store-off breaks first boot without it", asserted below as a hard gate, not a hope.
#
# THE CHANNEL (the acquisition gate's checksum story): gestion at the release content — public
# since ADR-0010, cloned by the Images workflow between the merge and the tag push, and this
# script re-runs gestion's own gates before a single byte enters the build context:
#   - the VENDOR sha256 gate (gestion test.sh:63-70's shape — version, sha256, tarball count),
#   - the tarball's own info.xml version must equal the VENDOR pin (the seed's probe parser),
#   - the eurooffice white-label patches applied with the three-outcome rule (ADR-0002:
#     forward-dry-run / reverse-dry-run / abort, via git apply — GNU patch fuzzes drifted
#     context, measured; a drifted patch fails the BUILD, never a clinic), then
#     signature.json dropped for patched apps (a patched app's vendor signature
#     no longer describes its files; Checker.php only checks apps that carry one),
#   - the white-label asserts the office smoke used to own (FRD S3: the smoke greps moved to
#     build time — under the suite nothing can revert the rename between builds, which is why
#     the runtime grep's threat model is empty and its retirement is slice 20's call).
#
# PARITY WITH THE SEED, deliberate and load-bearing: this mirrors lib.sh's
# ensure_vendored_app + apply_patch mechanics, because the seed's job at the clinic is to find
# every app already installed and write nothing (seed-idempotent's PASS) — and that only holds
# if the bytes baked here are the bytes the seed's VENDOR pins describe. Where the seed logs
# "already unpacked", the image must hold exactly that.
#
# WHY FORK-INFRA AND NOT A PATCH: files upstream does not ship live on the fork's main (the D6
# amendment; scripts/ is the mirror-parity allowlist). A patch would couple every bake tweak to
# a queue regeneration for zero benefit — and this file is upstream-shellcheck's territory
# anyway (the fork's CI runs it over **.sh on main).
#
# Usage: scripts/bake.sh GESTION_TREE OUT_DIR
#   GESTION_TREE — a checkout of gestion (provisioning/apps/ + themes/apsconecta read-only)
#   OUT_DIR      — the docker build-context dir this creates (aps-bake/); refused if non-empty
